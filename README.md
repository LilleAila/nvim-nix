# LilleAila's Neovim Configuration
My personal configuration files for [neovim](https://neovim.io/), powered by [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).

</div>

At some point, i might move this into [LilleAila/dotfiles](https://github.com/LilleAila/dotfiles) if it gets too hard to maintain two different flakes and link them together.

## Running
You can run the following command to test the configuration:
```bash
nix run github:LilleAila/nvim-nix
```

## Notes
This config was created using the nixvim flake template: `nix flake init --template github:nix-community/nixvim`, and following [vimjoyer's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b641h63lqy0)
Also it is important to note that it is important to note that is important to note.
