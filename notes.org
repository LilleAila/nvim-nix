**** TODO Fix molten.nvim kernels
It can not recignize kernels installed normally, for example through =nix-shell -p python311Packages.ipykernel=. They have to be installed like that, then run =python3 -m ipykernel install --user=, which is not good for nixOS, where it should be declarative.
**** TODO Add and configure [[https://github.com/benlubas/molten-nvim/blob/main/docs/NixOS.md][benlubas/molten-nvim]]
**** DONE Add more capture templates
